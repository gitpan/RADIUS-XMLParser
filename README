README for RADIUS::XMLParser module

This is a very quick initial release to get some comments on the
package and see if it turns out to be useful to anyone else.

Please read the RADIUS::XMLParser manpage for details, and an example of
how to parse and convert a given Radius log.

Please contact me if you have any problems or comments with this release.
